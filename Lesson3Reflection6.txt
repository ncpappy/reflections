When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Using a separate branch is good when I'm doing something that is experimental or perhaps I would like some feedback on from peer or collaborators before commiting to the master branch.

Using branches in this way may create more room for content conflicts especially if the branch is kept out of the master "stream" for a length of time.  

Doing changes on the master branch may upset collaborators or introduce unstable features.
