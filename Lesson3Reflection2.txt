Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes from a remote repository manually is good because sometimes the machine with the local repository may not have network connectivity.  Also I might be in the middle of making changes to the local repository and not ready to commit those, or have Git overwrite those with an "automated pull".

Manually pulling and pushing changes are both good for the reasons stated above.
