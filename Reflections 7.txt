How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a logical, or perhaps theoretical, collection of data and serves as a conceptual place to gather content before executing a commit.  This is valuable to be able to group content into logical collections before acting on that content group when doing commits, etc...
