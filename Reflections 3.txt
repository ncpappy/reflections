What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro
Manually controlling the commits allows us to intelligently execute a commit or save the copy between logical progression points.  

Con
Not being in the habit of committing will mean our commits, if any, will be too big to make the comparison useful in the future.
