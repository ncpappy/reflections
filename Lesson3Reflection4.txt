What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?

The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally is to have a point of reference of where my current 
local copy came from.  This allows for other commits to be made to 
the respective repository on Git Hub while my local copy has a means 
to understand the changes since the last sync.
